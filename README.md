# ECOS database
Ecological Congruency Object-Scene (ECOS) database is a collection of natural scenes optimized for standard visual tasks 
but that can easily be accommodated for other paradigms. A key aspect of this database 
is that it includes semantically matching and mismatching object-scene combinations 
which can be used to study many cognitive processes such as object-scene integration and segregation,
object detection  and identification and even visual search.

The images included in this data set have already been used in attention and memory studies.

Our aim is to offer a ever-updating site (https://sites.google.com/view/ecosdatabase) for researchers from all around the world 
to find sets of ecological stimuli for research purposes. In addition, we aim at 
providing a few examples of scripts of very common cognitive tasks with natural scenes 
for early-career scientists who want to initiate in programing with languages 
such as MatLab's Psychtoolbox and Python's Psychopy.
